I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), Switzerland. I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering Physics at Delhi Technological University (DTU), India. My Bachelor Thesis, titled *"Elevating Semantics: Fine-Grained Semantic Grounding for Enhanced Aerial Vision and Language Navigation"* was supervised by [Prof. Anil S. Parihar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JRr4wjoAAAAJ) (Department of Computer Science, DTU).

My research focuses on the intersection of deep learning and robotics, particularly learning end-to-end control (i.e., perception-to-actuation) of autonomous systems, formulating confidence of neural networks, and mathematical modeling of human mobility. Most recently, I have been working on *Vision-Language Navigation* at the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Reinforcement Learning. This challenging task requires an embodied agent to follow linguistic directives and visual features to navigate unknown environments.


I have garnered various accolades throughout my journey. Most recently, [Google Summer of Code 2025 Contributor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/IFR73yH5) at [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) under [Dr. Gary Bradski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Bradski). In Past, I have been awarded ThinkSwiss Research Scholarship 2023, which enabled me to collaborate with [Prof. Marcus Hudritsch](https://www.bfh.ch/en/about-bfh/people/5b7eblnby2di/) at Berner Fachhochschule. I have served as Team Manager and Autonomous Systems Lead for Team Defianz Racing, one of the first driverless formula student teams in India, for three years.
