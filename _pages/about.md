I am an incoming Masters in Artificial Intelligence student at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), Switzerland. I completed my Bachelors at Delhi Technological University (DTU), India in Engineering Physics. I defended my Bachelor Thesis titled "Elevating Semantics .. . " under the guidance of [Prof. Anil S. Parihar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JRr4wjoAAAAJ) (Department of Computer Science, DTU). Though my extensive experiences I have developed my niche at the intersection of deep learning and robotics.

The objective of my research is to develop the science and engineering of autonomy and its applications to safe decision making for autonomous agents. My vision is a world with adaptive autonomous agents capable of learning to interact in complex, uncertain, and extreme scenarios, supporting people with cognitive and physical tasks. I have worked on learning end-to-end control (i.e., perception-to-actuation) of autonomous systems, formulating confidence of neural networks, mathematical modeling of human mobility, as well as building complex inertial refinement systems.

As a researcher at heart, I have actively sought out opportunities to engage in research projects. I was awarded ThinkSwiss Research Scholarship 2023, which allowed me to collaborate with [Prof. Marcus Hudritsch](https://www.bfh.ch/en/about-bfh/people/5b7eblnby2di/) at Berner Fachhochschule. In the past, I have held the post of Team Manager and Autonomous System's Lead at Team Defianz Racing, one of the first driverless formula student teams in India, for 3 years.
