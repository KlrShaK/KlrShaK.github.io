Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am an incoming Masters in Artificial Intelligence student at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), Switzerland. I pursued my Bachelors at Delhi Technological University(DTU), India in Engineering Physics. I defended my Bachelor Thesis titled "Elevating Semantics .. . " under the guidance of [Prof. Anil S. Parihar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JRr4wjoAAAAJ) (Department of Computer Science, DTU). Though my extensive experiences I have developed my niche at the intersection of deep learning and robotics.

I have extensive experience on learning end-to-end control (i.e., perception-to-actuation) of autonomous systems, formulating confidence of neural networks, mathematical modeling of human mobility. Most recently, I have been working in Vision-Language Navigation at the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. The challenging task requires an embodied agent to follow lingual directives and visual features to navigate in an unknown environment.

As a researcher at heart, I have actively sought out opportunities to engage in research projects. I was awarded ThinkSwiss Research Scholarship 2023, which allowed me to collaborate with [Prof. Marcus Hudritsch](https://www.bfh.ch/en/about-bfh/people/5b7eblnby2di/) at Berner Fachhochschule. For 3 years, I held the post of Team Manager and Autonomous System's Lead at Team Defianz Racing, one of the first driverless formula student teams in India.
